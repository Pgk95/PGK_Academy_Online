Technologies:
To bring PGK Academy Online to fruition, a carefully curated selection of technologies will be harnessed. On the front-end, we will employ the classic trifecta of HTML5, CSS3, and javaScript(ES6) to craft an intuitive and user-friendly interface. While ReactJS stood as an alternative choice with its promise of enhanced component reusability, the decision was made to embrace simplicity for quicker development and streamlined maintenance. As for the back-end, the dynamic duo of Node.js and Express.js will orchestrate our server operations, ensuring efficient handling of asynchronous tasks and responsive user interactions. Flask,a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, was a compelling alternative, but the nod went to Node.js and Express.js for their compatibility and performance advantages. The data realm will be managed through MongoDB, housing user profiles and course information, while user authentication finds its stronghold in JSON Web Tokens(JWT). Seamless and secure payment processing will be realized through the integration of the Stripe API. When it comes to deployment, Heroku stands as the chosen vessel, offering a user-friendly journey compared to the more scalable yet complex pathways of Amazon Web Services(AWS). Git and Github will steer version control, VIsual Studio Code will be our compass for coding and debugging, and treasure trove of online tutorials and resources will serve as the guiding stars on our learning expedition. Each technology was chosen based on meticulous evaluation of factors such as project complexity, development efficiency, familiarity, and specific project requisites. These carefully chosen technologies unite to weave a digital tapestry that embodies the vision of PGK Academy Online, a platform poised to empower learners worldwide.

Infrastructure

Branching and Merging
Our team will follow the GitHub flow for branching and merging within our repository. Feature development and bug fixes will each have their own dedicated branches. When a feature or fix is ready for review, a pull request will be created. Collaborators will review the code, provide feedback, and once approved, changes will be merged into the main branch. This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, code review, and minimizes the risk of conflicts.

Deployment Strategy
For deployment, we will utilize Heroku, taking advantage of its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with Node.js and MongoDB. Continuous deployment will be implemented, where changes pushed to the main branch trigger automatic deployments to the production environment. This approach ensures a streamlined deployment process, enabling us to deliver updates and improvements to users efficiently.

Data Population
To populate the app with data, we will develop custom scripts to seed the MongoDB database with sample course content, user profiles, and other relevant data. This initial data population will provide a foundation for testing and demonstration purposes. As the platform evolves, administrators will have the capability to add, edit, and manage course content through a user-friendly admin interface.

Testing Approach
To ensure the quality and reliability of PGK Academy Online, we will employ a comprehensive testing approach. Unit tests will be created for individual components and functionalities, and integration tests will validate interactions between different parts of the application. Automated end-to-end testing will be implemented using tools such as Cypress to simulate user interactions and validate critical user flows. Continuous integration and automated testing will be key components of our development pipeline, helping us identify and address issues early in the development cycle.
